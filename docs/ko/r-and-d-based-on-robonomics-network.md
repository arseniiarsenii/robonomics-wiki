For over 4 years, the Robonomics project participants completed 13 R&D projects in the process of writing the current version of the Robonomics platform, including:

### Launching a drone under the control of a decentralized computer.
2016 - Successful field test of 3DR X8 drone compatibility with Drone Employee software.
Below you can observe a workflow in which a person sends a Drone transaction through the Ethereum Blockchain.

### Management of a fleet of drones in a decentralized network.
[Distributed Sky](https://airmarket.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Distributed-Sky-Whitepaper-v3.0.pdf) is the backbone of the Unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM). It uses a global network of computers to process and store identities, traffic and other sensitive information, and uses cryptography to make the UTM process secure and scalable.
Below is the video of Drone Passport agent in action.

### Tokenization of data from IoT devices.

The 4th industrial revolution is flying the flag of CPSs’ total integration into mass production and rendering services. Machines do not engage in empty talk, they are honest in their work and can be an independent party supplying information, based on algorithmic analysis of which the network itself can emit new units of any value.
Values based on the labor of machines will be much more interesting for the new generation than other values, the emission of which is built on any other principle. More information available [here](https://blog.aira.life/tokenization-and-the-4th-industrial-revolution-3208022be747)

### Digital markets for robots.

### Industrial zone management with capital.
[The article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8525391) presents the architecture of communication protocol for modern industrial processes and business based on cyber-physical systems - Industry 4.0. The main attention is paid to one of the key trends of this concept - to economical autonomous agents i.e. to robots or smart things, which are able to make decisions independently about their economic actions. Agents begin to fully participate in business processes, so it is important to automate the processes and ensure formal and secure communication between multiple heterogeneous agents, taking into account the economic component of the industry. The article shows how to organize economic interaction between agents using a peer-to-peer network based on decentralized Blockchain technology and smart contracts. More information about Industry 4.0 may be found in a video below.

### Drones, sensors, and blockchain for monitoring the quality of water on the Volga.
As part of [this river project](https://github.com/airalab/drone_on_volga), the drone offers its services through a web application allowing any user to request the service. Typically, the mission generates parameters such as drone position, travel speed, measured water quality parameters, and other minor requirements.
The Robonomics network is used to communicate with the robot. With its help, the robot can offer its services, and citizens or government officials can order them by making a cryptocurrency payment through the website. The Robonomics network is built on the Ethereum blockchain platform and the IPFS protocol, which record the hash of sensor measurements in the public blockchain and thus protect historical data from possible falsification.
Fascinating video about experiments with water drone is below.

### Civilian observatory networks.
In August 2018 Airalab with support of Smart Distribution (Libelium distributor in Russia) [set up a measuring network in a living district in Tolyatti, Russia](https://www.libelium.com/libeliumworld/success-stories/preventing-asthsma-sensor-network-air-quality-pm10-dust-in-play-area/).
The aim was to create the basis for the implementation of an air quality monitoring network in areas of special vulnerability (schools, playgrounds, nursing homes, hospitals, etc.) that can provide local authorities with information to take measures to protect their citizens.
An example of using a sensor is shown in a video below. Also, source code may be found [here](https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity).

### Robot artist Gaka-chu.
Modern technologies make human life more comfortable and more fun, freeing up time for reflection and experimentation.
It was a series of reflections on the static nature of the industry that led the development team to the idea of ​​conducting an experiment showing the autonomous transformation of production for a specific type of product.
Such an experiment became a [robot artist](https://github.com/airalab/robot_painter/) - a small, clumsy KUKA manipulator living in a large world of serious industrial robots. And his name is Gaka-chu. Why? Because of the love of drawing: "gaka" in Japanese is "artist". And "chu" was added for an inexplicable love for Pokemons.

### Issuance of green certificates based on the data from renewable energy sources.
The conceptual goal of [DAO IPCI](https://ipci.io/ru/) is to provide a common space, common environment, tools and ecosystem that is universal, reliable, easy to use, allowing a variety of stakeholders, including businesses and people, to record quantitative impacts and quantitative commitments, invest in negative impact mitigation projects, offset the carbon footprint, acquire and trade mitigation results, join existing programs or launch new ones. Source code is provided [here](https://github.com/DAO-IPCI/DAO-IPCI).

### Roadspace negotiation for autonomous cars.
Our goal was to develop a [decentralized system](https://github.com/khssnv/mobi_grand_challenge) for road space negotiation where autonomous vehicles can pay for routes and right of way. We believe a market-based approach can be used to alleviate a traffic congestion problem.

### Blockchain in the tasks of the chemical industry.
Originally the following task was set: developing a [quality control system](https://github.com/Vourhey/chemistry-quality-control) for the production of a certain chemical product. Why is monitoring the quality so important here? The main active substance of this chemical product is chlorine dioxide. It is hazardous to health in high concentrations. And if the concentration is below normal, then this chemical product is useless.
And what does Blockchain have to do with it? Blockchain helps building trust to the manufacturing company. The consumer knows that no one can change the information in the Blockchain. That means that the manufacturing company can not forge the results of the audit.

### Control of equipment maintenance process by supply chain participants based on IoT data.

### Robot as a service in service robotics.
Robonomics is the ready-to-work and open-source platform which you can use to connect your robot as a service for end-users, they call it [‘Robot-as-a-Service’](https://blog.aira.life/how-can-you-hire-a-robot-176ba29da565). Robonomics support Web3 technologies that implement the exchange of technical and economic information between humans and machines. Robonomics is a purely technical and open source project.
