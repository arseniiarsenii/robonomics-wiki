In this lesson you are going to learn how to connect your sensor to the network and make it publish data. You will see how it is easy to become a member of a global sensor network!

Source code is located [here](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_tutorials/tree/master/sensor_city).

In this section we are not going to create a liability contract. Instead we will teach Arduino with sensors to publish the data by a request. All measurements will be published as a Result message.

## Arduino

Let's begin with an Arduino circuit. You need the following components:

* Arduino Uno
* Optical Dust Sensor Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F
* Gas Sensor MQ-2
* Gas Sensor MQ-7
* Resistor 150 Ohm
* Capacitor 220 uF
* Wires

Connect all parts as described below:

A firmware for Arduino Uno is in `sensor_city/scetches` folder. In order to upload it to the board use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

## Aira

The following steps are performed in Aira client. You can download the latest image from [this page](https://github.com/airalab/aira/releases). It's convenient to [connect via SSH](/docs/aira-connecting-via-ssh/).

After you have imported the image to VirtualBox, connect Arduino via USB to your PC and enable serial port forwarding. You should check `Enable Serial Port` and assign `/dev/ttyACM0` in `Path/Address`. Inside the virtual machine `/dev/ttyS0` refers to your external Arduino.

Finally launch the image and run these command:

```
$ roslaunch sensor_city publish_data.launch
```

**Check out the source code to learn how it works under the hood!**

Now Aira patiently waits for a signal to publish the measurements. Go to [Dapp](https://dev.aira.life/smart-city/#/) and click on `Broadcast signal`. You should see the data!
