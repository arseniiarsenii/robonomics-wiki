## What is Sensors Robonomics Network?

The Sensors Robonomics Network is a civilian network of sensors to monitor air quality. Anyone can build their own sensor or use an off-the-shelf solution from the development team and set it up in their home. The sensors use open source software and component wiring diagrams. One of the main sensors used is the PM10 and PM2.5 fine particulate sensor.

## What is PM10 and PM2.5?

PM10 is a particle of a substance 10 microns or smaller, PM2.5 is a particle 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller. They are constantly floating in the air and do not settle due to their small size, for comparison, the thickness of a human hair is 100 microns. These particles can appear for a variety of reasons, including industrial processes involving the handling of bulk materials or the burning and processing of minerals. They are also emitted after forest fires and dust storms. In addition, they can come from conventional transport when burning fuel or from wear and tear on tires and pavement. Car tires are wiped out into fine crumbs and the wind blows them from the roads all over the city.

## Why do we need to measure them?

PM10 and PM2.5 are the most dangerous because their size allows them to penetrate the lungs, whereas larger particles tend to linger in the nose or throat. Larger PM10 particles irritate the airways, nose, throat, and eyes. Particles smaller than 2.5 microns can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. The effects of these particles on the human body can be devastating:
- poisoning by harmful substances entering the bloodstream
- allergic reactions
- bacterial and fungal infections
- cancer
- mucous membrane irritation
- exacerbation of respiratory symptoms

## Why the Sensors Robonomics Network?

In Russia there are other public monitoring networks, such as [Breathe Moscow](https://breathe.moscow/), which are based on the German project [sensor.community](https://sensor.community/ru/). But they use the usual client-server architecture, which in this case is a drawback. Data from all sensors together with user requests go to one server, which cannot always handle such load. So there are situations when the map with data is not available at the most responsible moments. With Sensors Robonomics Network, sensors send data to several different servers, and any user can bring up the Sensors Connectivity server for their sensor and see it on the map. The map itself is not overloaded because it is a decentralized application (DApp) that works directly from your browser with the data that the servers send to the IPFS pub-sub channel.
