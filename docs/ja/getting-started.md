## What is Robonomics

Robonomics platform provides tools for working with the robot economy network. Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the [autonomous robots services](/docs/glossary#cyber-physical-system), provide [direct user access via dapp](/docs/glossary#dapp) for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn will allow us to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.

The following chart describes what place Robonomics takes in the scenario:

## What the documentation contains

### Robonomics Network quick start
Start with quick example of what Robonomics is able to do within 5 minutes: [DEMO "Get Weather on Fuji Mountain"](/docs/get-weather-on-fuji-mountain).

### I'm interested in using Robonomics services

Take a look at the [Robonomics Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). Get familiar with the statistic, average miner reward etc.
Try out existing [services](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services)

### I'm a Dapp developer

- [Robonomics-js on GitHub](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) - simple Javascript SDK for Robonomics Network dApp developers.
- [dApp template](https://github.com/airalab/vue-dapp-robonomics-template) - uses Vue.js
- [Wiki documentation](/docs/robonomics-js/)

### I'm a robotics engineer

Check out [cases](/docs/iot-sensors-connectivity/) section and start developing by [examples](/docs/agent-development-examples).
