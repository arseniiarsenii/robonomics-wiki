## Agent

In terms of Robonomics Network agent is a program module that uses IPFS or blockchain or both interfaces of the network and does some actual work.
Usually it's represented as a ROS package and it may connect (but not necessarily) a real cyber-physical system to the Robonomics Network.

## Cyber-physical system

It is a combination of a physical mechanism that is usually called a robot and a program algorithm that controls the behavior of the mechanism.

## Dapp

It is a short form for Decentralized application. Usually it is a single page web based application that helps to interact with an agent.

## IPFS

According to the official [documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/) "IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data".
For more detail how it works go to the official website.

## Lighthouse

A lighthouse is an autonomous workflow that allows us to distribute the running time of providers that serve a single broadcast channel.

For more information read [Robonomics Whitepaper](https://static.robonomics.network/docs/whitepaper/Robonomics-whitepaper-en.pdf) section 5.2.

## Sidechain

Ethereum based blockchain network with Proof-of-Authority consensus owned by Airalab.
